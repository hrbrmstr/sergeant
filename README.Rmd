`sergeant` : Tools to Transform and Query Data with 'Apache' 'Drill'

Drill + `sergeant` is (IMO) a nice alternative to Spark + `sparklyr` if you don't need the ML components of Spark (i.e. just need to query "big data" sources, need to interface with parquet, need to combine disparate data source types — json, csv, parquet, rdbms - for aggregation, etc). Drill also has support for spatial queries.

I find writing SQL queries to parquet files with Drill on a local linux or macOS workstation to be more performant than doing the data ingestion work with R (for large or disperate data sets). I also work with many tiny JSON files on a daily basis and Drill makes it much easier to do so. YMMV.

You can download Drill from <https://drill.apache.org/download/> (use "Direct File Download"). I use `/usr/local/drill` as the install directory. `drill-embedded` is a super-easy way to get started playing with Drill on a single workstation and most of my workflows can get by using Drill this way. If there is sufficient desire for an automated downloader and a way to start the `drill-embedded` server from within R, please file an issue.

There are a few convenience wrappers for various informational SQL queries (like `drill_version()`). Please file an PR if you add more.

The package has been written with retrieval of rectangular data sources in mind. If you need/want a version of `drill_query()` that will enable returning of non-rectangular data (which is possible with Drill) then please file an issue.

Some of the more "controlling vs data ops" REST API functions aren't implemented. Please file a PR if you need those.

Finally, I run most of this locally and at home, so it's all been coded with no authentication or encryption in mind. If you want/need support for that, please file an issue. If there is demand for this, it will change the R API a bit (I've already thought out what to do but have no need for it right now).

The following functions are implemented:

**`DBI`**

- As complete of an R `DBI` driver has been implemented using the Drill REST API, mostly to facilitate the `dplyr` interface. Use the `RJDBC` driver interface if you need more `DBI` functionality.
- This also means that SQL functions unique to Drill have also been "implemented" (i.e. made accessible to the `dplyr` interface). If you have custom Drill SQL functions that need to be implemented please file an issue on GitHub.

**`RJDBC`**

- `drill_jdbc`:	Connect to Drill using JDBC, enabling use of said idioms. See `RJDBC` for more info.
- NOTE: The DRILL JDBC driver fully-qualified path must be placed in the `DRILL_JDBC_JAR` environment variable. This is best done via `~/.Renviron` for interactive work. i.e. `DRILL_JDBC_JAR=/usr/local/drill/jars/drill-jdbc-all-1.9.0.jar`

**`dplyr`**: 

- `src_drill`: Connect to Drill (using dplyr) + supporting functions

See `dplyr` for the `dplyr` operations (light testing shows they work in basic SQL use-cases but Drill's SQL engine has issues with more complex queries).

**Drill APIs**:

- `drill_connection`: Setup parameters for a Drill server/cluster connection
- `drill_active`: Test whether Drill HTTP REST API server is up
- `drill_cancel`:	Cancel the query that has the given queryid
- `drill_jdbc`:	Connect to Drill using JDBC
- `drill_metrics`:	Get the current memory metrics
- `drill_options`:	List the name, default, and data type of the system and session options
- `drill_profile`:	Get the profile of the query that has the given query id
- `drill_profiles`:	Get the profiles of running and completed queries
- `drill_query`:	Submit a query and return results
- `drill_set`:	Set Drill SYSTEM or SESSION options
- `drill_settings_reset`:	Changes (optionally, all) session settings back to system defaults
- `drill_show_files`:	Show files in a file system schema.
- `drill_show_schemas`:	Returns a list of available schemas.
- `drill_stats`:	Get Drillbit information, such as ports numbers
- `drill_status`:	Get the status of Drill
- `drill_storage`:	Get the list of storage plugin names and configurations
- `drill_system_reset`:	Changes (optionally, all) system settings back to system defaults
- `drill_threads`:	Get information about threads
- `drill_uplift`:	Turn a columnar query results into a type-converted tbl
- `drill_use`:	Change to a particular schema.
- `drill_version`:	Identify the version of Drill running

### Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/sergeant")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
options(width=120)
```

### Experimental `dplyr` interface

```{r message=FALSE}
library(sergeant)

ds <- src_drill("localhost")  # use localhost if running standalone on same system otherwise the host or IP of your Drill server
ds

db <- tbl(ds, "cp.`employee.json`") 

# without `collect()`:
count(db, gender, marital_status)

# ^^ gets translated to:
# 
# SELECT *
# FROM (SELECT  gender ,  marital_status , COUNT(*) AS  n 
#       FROM  cp.`employee.json` 
#       GROUP BY  gender ,  marital_status )  govketbhqb 
# LIMIT 1000

count(db, gender, marital_status) %>% collect()

# ^^ gets translated to:
# 
# SELECT  gender ,  marital_status , COUNT(*) AS  n 
# FROM  cp.`employee.json` 
# GROUP BY  gender ,  marital_status 

group_by(db, position_title) %>% 
  count(gender) -> tmp2

group_by(db, position_title) %>% 
  count(gender) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(full_desc=ifelse(gender=="F", "Female", "Male")) %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  select(Title=position_title, Gender=full_desc, Count=n)

# ^^ gets translated to:
# 
# SELECT  position_title ,  gender ,  n ,
#         CASE WHEN ( gender  = 'F') THEN ('Female') ELSE ('Male') END AS  full_desc 
# FROM (SELECT  position_title ,  gender , COUNT(*) AS  n 
#       FROM  cp.`employee.json` 
#       GROUP BY  position_title ,  gender )  dcyuypuypb 

arrange(db, desc(employee_id)) %>% print(n=20)

# ^^ gets translated to:
# 
# SELECT *
# FROM (SELECT *
#       FROM  cp.`employee.json` 
#       ORDER BY  employee_id  DESC)  lvpxoaejbc 
# LIMIT 5

mutate(db, position_title=tolower(position_title)) %>%
  mutate(salary=as.numeric(salary)) %>% 
  mutate(gender=ifelse(gender=="F", "Female", "Male")) %>%
  mutate(marital_status=ifelse(marital_status=="S", "Single", "Married")) %>% 
  group_by(supervisor_id) %>% 
  summarise(underlings_count=n()) %>% 
  collect()

# ^^ gets translated to:
# 
# SELECT  supervisor_id , COUNT(*) AS  underlings_count 
# FROM (SELECT  employee_id ,  full_name ,  first_name ,  last_name ,  position_id ,  position_title ,  store_id ,  department_id ,  birth_date ,  hire_date ,  salary ,  supervisor_id ,  education_level ,  gender ,  management_role , CASE WHEN ( marital_status  = 'S') THEN ('Single') ELSE ('Married') END AS  marital_status 
#       FROM (SELECT  employee_id ,  full_name ,  first_name ,  last_name ,  position_id ,  position_title ,  store_id ,  department_id ,  birth_date ,  hire_date ,  salary ,  supervisor_id ,  education_level ,  marital_status ,  management_role , CASE WHEN ( gender  = 'F') THEN ('Female') ELSE ('Male') END AS  gender

# GROUP BY  supervisor_id 
```

### Usage

```{r}
library(sergeant)

# current verison
packageVersion("sergeant")

dc <- drill_connection("localhost") 

drill_active(dc)

drill_version(dc)

drill_storage(dc)$name
```

Working with the built-in JSON data sets:

```{r}
drill_query(dc, "SELECT * FROM cp.`employee.json` limit 100")

drill_query(dc, "SELECT COUNT(gender) AS gender FROM cp.`employee.json` GROUP BY gender")

drill_options(dc)

drill_options(dc, "json")
```

## Working with parquet files

```{r}
drill_query(dc, "SELECT * FROM dfs.`/usr/local/drill/sample-data/nation.parquet` LIMIT 5")
```

Including multiple parquet files in different directories (note the wildcard support):

```{r}
drill_query(dc, "SELECT * FROM dfs.`/usr/local/drill/sample-data/nations*/nations*.parquet` LIMIT 5")
```

### A preview of the built-in support for spatial ops

Via: <https://github.com/k255/drill-gis>

A common use case is to select data within boundary of given polygon:

```{r}
drill_query(dc, "
select columns[2] as city, columns[4] as lon, columns[3] as lat
    from cp.`sample-data/CA-cities.csv`
    where
        ST_Within(
            ST_Point(columns[4], columns[3]),
            ST_GeomFromText(
                'POLYGON((-121.95 37.28, -121.94 37.35, -121.84 37.35, -121.84 37.28, -121.95 37.28))'
                )
            )
")
```

### JDBC

```{r}
library(RJDBC)

# Use this if connecting to a cluster with zookeeper
# con <- drill_jdbc("drill-node:2181", "drillbits1") 

# Use the following if running drill-embedded
con <- drill_jdbc("localhost:31010", use_zk=FALSE)

drill_query(con, "SELECT * FROM cp.`employee.json`")

# but it can work via JDBC function calls, too
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM cp.`employee.json`") %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble()
```

### Test Results

```{r}
library(sergeant)
library(testthat)

date()

test_dir("tests/")
```
